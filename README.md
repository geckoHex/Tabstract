A simple new tab page for Chrome because I didn't like the default one. Mostly vibe coded. Thanks to [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) for the icons used.

To install, clone to disk, go to chrome extensions, activate dev mode, click "load unpacked", select extension folder.

This extension is not made nor endorsed by Google. The "G" mark in the search bar is a G from the icon provider.
